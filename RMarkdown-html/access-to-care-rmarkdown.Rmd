## `r params$state`

### Background

We are trying to determine which counties in **`r params$state`** have comparatively more access or less access to hospital care.

A **statistical model using data from across the country** is used to identify those counties that have more or less than the model expects the specific county to have.

### County Map

Breakdown of counties and their status based on county population compared to the number of hospitals

```{r, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 9}
atc_plot_state_map(state = params$state)
```

### County Data

Here is the county level data used in this report

```{r}
us_counties %>% 
  filter(state_name == params$state) %>% 
  select(county_name, hospitals, population) %>% 
  datatable(colnames = c("County" = "county_name", "Hospitals" = "hospitals", "Population" = "population"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
attach_connect_email(
  render_connect_email("access-to-care-email.Rmd"),
  subject = paste0("Access to Care - ", params$state)
)
```
