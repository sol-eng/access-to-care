#  Access to Care 
## `r params$state`

### County Map - Hospital Coverage

Breakdown of counties and their status based on county population compared to the number of hospitals

```{r}
atc_plot_state_map(state = params$state)
```

### Counties Under or Over the exepected number of hospitals

```{r}
us_counties %>% 
  filter(state_name == params$state) %>% 
  select(county_name, hospitals, population) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  fmt_number(
    columns = population,
    suffixing = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  cols_label("county_name" = "County", "hospitals" = "Hospitals", "population" = "Population")
```

### Background

We are trying to determine which counties in **`r params$state`** have comparatively more access or less access to hospital care. A **statistical model using data from across the country** is used to identify those counties that have more or less than the model expects the specific county to have.
