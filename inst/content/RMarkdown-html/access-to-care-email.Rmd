#  Access to Care 
## `r params$state`

### County Map - Hospital Coverage

Breakdown of counties and their status based on county population compared to the number of hospitals

```{r}
full_map %>%
  mutate(group = paste(county_id, shape_id)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(
    aes(long, lat, group = group), 
    fill = full_map$color,
    alpha = 0.5,
    color = "#666666",
    size = 0.1
    ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_blank(), 
    axis.text = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank()) 
```

### Counties Under or Over the exepected number of hospitals

```{r}
display_table %>%
  filter(`Model Result` != "Acceptable") %>%
  formattable::format_table()
```

### Background

We are trying to determine which counties in **`r params$state`** have comparatively more access or less access to hospital care. A **statistical model using data from across the country** is used to identify those counties that have more or less than the model expects the specific county to have.
